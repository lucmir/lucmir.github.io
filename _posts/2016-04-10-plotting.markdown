Analysing raw data, especially when dealing with a lot of information, can be challenging.
In many applications it is absolutely useful to turn data in a visualization.
With elementary data visualization and very simple statistical analysis we can have a better understanding of inputs.

Suppose we want to analyse the performance of students in an exam.

Here we have the distribution of scores for a class of 20 students.
Each line shows a specific score (ranging from 0 to 10) and the number of students that scored it.
For example, score 10 was reached just by one student.

{% highlight text %}
0 0
1 1
2 2
3 1
4 3
5 2
6 4
7 3
8 2
9 1
10 1
{% endhighlight %}

## Mean and Standard Deviation ##

We can calculate mean ($$\mu$$) and standard deviation ($$\sigma$$):<br/>

$$\mu = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^na_i = \frac{1}{n}\left(a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n\right)$$<br/>

$$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\mu)^2}$$<br/>

Mean provides a global overview of the result while standard deviation indicates how close individual scores are to the mean.

For our sample data, $$\mu = 5.5$$ and $$\sigma = 2.41704$$

Standard deviation interpretation depends on the sampling scheme or the experiment. We can estimate the *Coefficient of Variation* ($$CV=\sigma/\mu$$) and, as a "rule of thumb", we consider that $$CV >= 1$$ indicates a relatively high variation, while $$CV < 1$$ can be considered low. In our case study $$CV = 0.43946 < 1$$.


## Plotting Distribution ##

We can plot the distribution as a bar chart using **Gnuplot**.
The script below generate a simple bar chart as a *png* image.

{% highlight gnuplot linenos=table %}
reset
set terminal png font arial 14 size 800,600

set style data histogram
set encoding utf8
set xlabel "scores"
set title "Score Distribution"
set key off
set boxwidth 0.5 absolute
set style fill solid 1.0
set ytics 1
set yrange[0:*]

set output "scoreDist.png"
plot "data.txt" using 2:xtic(1) with boxes
{% endhighlight %}

With Gnuplot installed, save script as *plot.gp* and run: *gnuplot plot.gp*. 
Distribution data must be saved as *data.txt* before executing the script.
The following image will be generated in the current dir:

<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/2016-04-10-plotting/scoreDist.png" width="520"/>
</div>
<br/>
Each bar represents the number of students with the respective score.


## Cumulative Distribution Function ##

The **Cumulative Distribution Function** (CDF) of a distribution function of a random variable $$X$$ is the probability that $$X$$ will take a value less than or equal to $$x$$:

$$F_X(x) = \operatorname{P}(X\leq x)$$

Generating cumulative distribution function from distribution:

{% highlight bash linenos=table %}
#!/bin/bash

INFILE=$1
OUTFILE=$2

TOTAL=`awk -F " " 'BEGIN {x=0;} {x+=$2;} END {print x;}' $INFILE`;
awk -v total="$TOTAL" -F " " 'BEGIN {sum=0;} {sum+=$2; print $1" "(sum);}' $INFILE > $OUTFILE
{% endhighlight %}

The code above can be executed as a *bash* script: save the code as *generateCDF.sh*, give execution permission (*chmod +x generateCDF.sh*) and run *./generateCDF.sh inputfile outputfile*. CDF data will be generated in *outputfile*.

The same Gnuplot script (just change output and input filenames) will generate the following chart:
<div align="center">
    <img src="/assets/2016-04-10-plotting/scoreDist_cdf.png" width="520"/>
</div>
<br/>
Each bar in this chart can be interpreted as the number of occurrences (students) in sample data that scored less or equal than the corresponding value in bar. For example, all students (20) had a score of 10 or less (10 is the maximum allowed value), but only 3 students had a score of 2 or less.

Taking the difference between two bars, we can obtain the number of students that scored between two values. For example, 9 students scored less or equal 5 and 16 students scored less or equal 7, so 7 students (16-9) scored between 5 and 7.


## Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function ##

We can either study the opposite question: how often the random variable is above a particular level? The **Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF)** or Tail Distribution is defined as:

$$\bar F(x) = \operatorname{P}(X > x) = 1 - F(x)$$

Generating complementary cumulative distribution function from distribution:

{% highlight bash linenos=table %}
#!/bin/bash

INFILE=$1
OUTFILE=$2

TOTAL=`awk -F " " 'BEGIN {x=0;} {x+=$2;} END {print x;}' $INFILE`;
awk -v total="$TOTAL" -F " " 'BEGIN {sum=0;} {print $1" "(total-sum); sum+=$2;}' $INFILE > $OUTFILE;
{% endhighlight %}

The code above can be executed as a *bash* script: save the code as *generateCCDF.sh*, give execution permission (*chmod +x generateCCDF.sh*) and run *./generateCCDF.sh inputfile outputfile*. The CCDF data will be generated in *outputfile*.

The same Gnuplot script (just change output and input filenames) will generate the following chart:

<div align="center">
	<img src="/assets/2016-04-10-plotting/scoreDist_ccdf.png" width="520"/>
</div>
<br/>
Each bar in this chart can be interpreted as the number of occurrences (students) in sample data that scored equal or more than the corresponding value in bar. For example, all students (20) scored at least 0 (negative values are not allowed), but only 4 students had a score of 8 or more.

This chart is useful to ask, for example, "how many students reached at least 60%?". We can get it by checking directly the number of students corresponding to score 6: 11 students reached at least 60%.

  

In conclusion, CDF and CCDF are valuable and simple to implement tools that can be great complements to distribution analysis.
