description: Using Jekyll + GitHub Pages to build and host a simple Blog
---

<!-- In the first page of Jekyll site you can read "Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs". This was my motivation to start a Blog.
Before knowing about Jekyll I decided that I needed to document some solutions (like code snippets) to recurrent problems in my daily routine as a developer.
I decided to document on Web and to make it public (maibe your problem was my problem). So I realized that my project became a blog.

As I didn't want to spend a lot of time learning Blog tools, I searched...

When I decided to start a Blog I didn't want to spend a lot of time learning about Blog platforms or building a CMS from scratch. 
<!-- My objective is just to document some recurrent solutions, so I it must be clean, fast to build and  -->

I found the perfect solution (free and easy) for building fast a clean and easy to mantain Blog:

- With [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) you can start a Blog with few command lines. 
- With [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) you can host your Blog for free (with version control of coarse).

## Jekyll ##

Jekyll is a "Simple, blog-aware, static site generator". Some Jekyll advantages:

- Jekyll uses Markdown, a easy-to-use syntax with code block support.
- Jekyll has support for common templates, such as headers and footers, that are shared across files.
- As Jekyll is a static HTML site generator, your Blog will be lightweight.
- No need for database.
- Simplicity.

Installing some requisits (for Ubuntu users):

## GitHub Pages ##

GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and published through GitHub.

Using Github Pages is easy: 

- Create a new repository named username.github.io, where username is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.
- Add, commit and push a *index.html*.
- Access http://username.github.io

To **host your Jekyll Blog on GitHub Pages** just push your unbuilt Jekyll Blog to the master branch of your user repository.
GitHub Pages will build the static website and serve it. It's also possible to host pages for your projects on GitHub Pages.
